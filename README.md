 # `Snake Game`   
 ---      
 ### `Description`  
 I recreated the classic Snake Game! üêç

#### What is the Snake Game?

The Snake Game is a classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around the screen. The objective is to eat food items that appear randomly on the screen to grow longer. However, as the snake grows, it becomes increasingly challenging to navigate without running into the walls or colliding with its own tail.

### `Installation`

#### How to Play?

- **Controls:** Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction‚Äîup, down, left, and right.
- **Objective:** Eat as many food items as possible to score points and grow longer.
- **Challenge:** Be cautious not to run into the walls or collide with the snake's tail, as this will end the game.
